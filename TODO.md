# TODO

- template file / python script for generating new project scripts

- guess the project number from the main filename (__main__.__file__)

- better print the time interval, especially for very small intervals

- if euler is ran, show how many projects have been completed / which is next to do

- put all resources in their respective scripts, no need for resource file parsing

# COMPLETED


# TRASHED
