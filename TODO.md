# TODO

- write README

# COMPLETED

- template file / python script for generating new project scripts
- if euler is ran, show how many projects have been completed / which is next to do
- webscrape for problem name
- constant for problem dir
- put all resources in their respective scripts, no need for resource file parsing
- better print the time interval, especially for very small intervals

# TRASHED

- guess the project number from the main filename (__main__.__file__) => project number (and title) are now stored in the doc string
